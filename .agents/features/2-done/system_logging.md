# Feature: System Logging & Audit

## User Flow
Users can track every stage of a trade or signal lifecycle via the "History" and "Analysis" tabs in the Dashboard.

## Key Capabilities
- **Execution Tracking**: Every MT5 response is logged as `TRADE_ACK` with specific broker return codes.
- **AI Audit**: Full raw JSON from AI analysis is captured and viewable.
- **Auto-Sync Logs**: Background reconciliation events (price updates, closes) are logged automatically.

## Technical Event Types
- `SIGNAL_FANOUT`: Signal distribution start.
- `TRADE_ACK`: Success/Rejection feedback from MT5.
- `ACCOUNT_SYNC`: Balance/Equity updates.
- `TRADE_SYNC_CLOSE`: Auto-detection of trade closure.
- `AI_RESPONSE`: Captured AI signal data.

## Implementation Details
- **Storage**: `logs` table (JSONB metadata).
- **Triggers**: MT5 EA polling and Webhook AI generation.
