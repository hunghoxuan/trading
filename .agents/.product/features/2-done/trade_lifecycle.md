# Feature: Trade Lifecycle Management

## User Flow
Managing the full journey of a trade from "Pending" to "Closed".

## Key Capabilities
- **Manual Overrides**: Edit Entry, SL, TP, or Volume directly from the UI.
- **Cancellation**: Cancel pending orders before they are picked up by the EA.
- **Manual Closure**: Close open trades immediately with a single click.
- **Renewals**: Re-queue failed or cancelled trades for execution.
- **Automated Sync**: If a trade is closed on the broker (TP/SL hit), the dashboard reflects it automatically.
- **Trade Detail Chart Review**: Trade Detail opens with a two-column timeframe grid by default, supports client-side `+/-` chart density changes, uses multi-select overlay toggles for `P1`, `P2`, `PD`, and `KL`, redraws overlays immediately on toggle, keeps static charts fitted to the full tile bounds during resize, and syncs crosshair movement across static timeframe charts.
- **Planner Consistency Logic**: Trade Detail planner auto-updates `TP` when `RR` changes and auto-updates `RR` when `Entry/TP/SL` change, applies side/type/level validation with inline client errors, auto-derives direction/order-type from coherent level relationships, and supports drag-updating primary `Entry/TP/SL` directly on static charts.
- **Broker Risk Display**: Signal/trade summary stats prefer broker-reported `volume_size` when available so the UI shows actual synced volume percentage instead of a local fallback estimate.

## Technical Details
- **Endpoints**: `/v2/trades/create`, `/mt5/trades/cancel`, `/mt5/trades/delete`, `/mt5/trades/renew`.
- **States**: `PENDING`, `PLACED`, `FILLED`, `CLOSED`, `CANCELLED`, `REJECTED`.
- **Validation**: Enforces `MAX_RISK_PCT` and `ALLOW_SYMBOLS` constraints before creating trades.
